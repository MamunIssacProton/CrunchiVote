# CrunchiVote App (backend + frontend)

# Prerequisites

- ## .Net8
- ## Docker
- ## global dotnet efcore tool

### 99.5% pure .net framework used, no 3rd party library used for this project except polly for implementing resiliency

#### projects are implented to follow `Domain Driven Design` process, `CQRS  `architectural pattern,`SOLID Principles` `OPTION Pattern` `Result Pattern` development guideline

## How to run / setup this project on your local environment
# Latest update
1. clone this repository by following this command

   `git clone https://github.com/MamunIssacProton/CrunchiVote.git`
   using your terminal/command prompt

2. navigate to the project directory. you can use command like `cd CrunchiVote`

3. execute the startup.sh bash file with a bash terminal by following

`bash setup.sh`

### That's all you need to do the setup on this updated version

<!-- 
or use visual studio code docker plugin to do docker-compose-up operation

4. Open the Solution (sln file) in Visual Studio or your IDE

5. Select the `CrunchiVote.Infrastructure` project to do the

### Databse migrations

you can also navigate to the project by usng

`cd CrunchiVote/backend/src/CrunchiVote.Infrastructure`

from previous working directory

6. do migration by following this command

   `dotnet ef migrations add init`

   you can use your own migration name insted of init

7. apply pending migrations to database by following this command

   `dotent ef database update`

8. make sure you've performed database migrations on `CrunchiVote.Identity Project also`, to do the migration, use this command by navigating to `CrunchiVote/backend/src/CrunchiVote.Identity` project
   and running
   `dotent ef database update`
9. now select `CrunchiVote.Api` project to run the api project. you can use `dotnet run ` or `dotnet watch` by navigating `CrunchiVote/backend/src/CrunchiVote.Api` project.

10. For Front-end Application, nagivate to `CrunchiVote/frontend/crunchivote` directory and run `npm install` to perform `npm start` and this will run the front-end.
11. Make sure you are running the `backend` applicaion first and the `front end application to see the data on web app` else you can still use the `APIs`by running the `backend` project and navigating your localhost like
    `http://localhost:5254/swagger/index.html` to see all available endpoints.

### There is no Database seeding technique implemented on project, so in order to test all feature, please do consider by creating by using api endpoints.

## Due to Visual Studio for mac does not support any workload for .NET 8, I've used Individual project configurations appsettings.json for independent database migration.such as `Infrastructre` and `Identity` project and due to same file as output file from multiple project, the given `Dockerfile` or `dotnet publish` will not working or unable to build the `docker image`.
